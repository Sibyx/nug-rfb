# nug-vnc

**Work in progress!**

Simple implementation of the VNC server (RFB protocol) based on the 
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html) module and the 
[rfbproto](https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto) specification.

This project is a part of my master thesis on the 
[Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies STU in Bratislava](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html) on the
subject of KVM switch implementation.

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a package manager.
